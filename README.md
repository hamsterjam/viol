Making games in WebGL

So, all my past HTML5 projects have used a library in some shape or form to get things done. I usually use [pixi.js](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/). My shitty WebGL projects use a matrix library and I don't think I have ever bothered to write a XMLHttpRequest manually. This all changes here, I'm just going to sit down and write code untill I have a semi-functional base for HTML5 games.
